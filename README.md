# Loan Amortization Schedule Generator

Welcome to my Loan Amortization Schedule Generator repository! In this project, I demonstrate my skills by designing a loan amortization model that generates a schedule detailing the principal and interest payments over the life of a loan. The model considers different types of loans and repayment scenarios.
